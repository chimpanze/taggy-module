# Changes to Taggy Module

## Issue: useState not suitable for storing taggyClient

### Problem
The module was using `useState` to initialize and store the taggyClient instance, which was causing the module to break. The issue description stated: "useState does not allow to store this and the module breaks."

### Solution
Changed the approach from using `useState` to using Nuxt's provide/inject pattern, which is the recommended way to share instances in Nuxt applications.

### Changes Made

1. In `/src/runtime/plugins/taggy.ts`:
   - Removed `useState` from imports
   - Removed the line `useState('taggy:client', () => taggyClient)` that was storing the client in state
   - Kept the `nuxtApp.provide('taggy', taggyClient)` line, which is the recommended way to share instances

2. In `/src/runtime/composables/useTaggy.ts`:
   - Added `useNuxtApp` to imports
   - Changed how we access the client from:
     ```typescript
     const taggyClient = useState<TaggyClient>('taggy:client')
     ```
     to:
     ```typescript
     const { $taggy } = useNuxtApp()
     const taggyClient = $taggy as TaggyClient
     ```
   - Removed `.value` references when accessing the client's services (e.g., changed `taggyClient.value.auth` to `taggyClient.auth`)
   - Updated the return statement to return the client directly (`client: taggyClient` instead of `client: taggyClient.value`)

### Testing
To verify that these changes resolve the issue:

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Check that the Taggy client is properly initialized and accessible in the playground.

3. Verify that all Taggy services (auth, content, tags, etc.) work as expected.

### Reasoning
The provide/inject pattern is the recommended way to share instances in Nuxt applications. It allows for:

1. Better type safety (with TypeScript)
2. More predictable behavior across the application
3. Proper handling of complex objects and instances
4. Avoiding issues with reactivity that can occur when using `useState` for non-primitive values

This approach aligns with Nuxt's best practices for plugin development and should provide a more robust solution for sharing the taggyClient instance throughout the application.
